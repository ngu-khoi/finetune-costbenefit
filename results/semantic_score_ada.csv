All conductors exhibit an effective diamagnetism when they experience a changing magnetic field.,"There are two parts to this sentence: first, all conductors exhibit an effective diamagnetism; and second, when they experience a changing magnetic field. The first part is easy- all materials have some degree of diamagnetism, which is the tendency of a material to resist the flow of electric current in the direction of the magnetic field. This is why a wire will become twisted when it is placed in a magnetic field- the current is trying to go in all directions at once, and the magnetic field is preventing it from going in a specific direction.

The second part is a little more complicated. When a conductor is in a changing magnetic field, the electrons in the material are moving around. This movement creates a magnetic field in the vicinity of the conductor, which opposes the original magnetic field. This opposing field causes the electrons to move even more, and the resulting magnetic field is even stronger than the original field. This process is called self-amplification, and it is what makes a changing magnetic field an effective diamagnet.",0.7339308261871338
